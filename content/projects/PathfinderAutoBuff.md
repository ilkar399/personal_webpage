A modification for the Pathfinder: Kingmaker and Pathfinder: Wrath of The Righteous computer games. This games are quite notorious with the amount of magic buffs you may want to regularily put on  your characters and I've thought it would be nice to have some sort of automation tool out there. Uses C# for the modifications of the in-game code and UI created in Unity.
