This project is a work on the data collection for game applications/DLCs from Steam and SteamSpy. Data is collected using different APIs, cleaned up and processed using Pandas for the further analysis.

Currently WIP, specifically for the Airflow automatic collection scripts and possibly a database storage.

There is also some analysis and chart building using Plotly.
