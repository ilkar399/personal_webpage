This is a small project on analyzing the data on the players' private housing in Final Fantasy XIV MMORPG. 

The developers have changet the way players' houses were obtained to the lottery-like system and with the
release of the new player housing area it was an interesting opportunity to analyze the players' preferances.
Sadly, the data could only be collected manually so I've decided to limit it to the Datacenter I was playing on.
