This is a project I've made as a part of my job search. HeadHunter is the largest Russian job search/vacancies website and it has a relatively good API available for usage. Here I used Python/Pandas to get the vacancies and do some analysis and Google Sheets + DataLense for storage and Dashboarding. It was quite useful for my current skillset analysis and a way to prioritize the skill-up process.
