This project is an analysis of the Steam reviews for the [Crusader Kings
III: Royal Court
DLC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158310/Crusader_Kings_III/).
When I was exploring Steam reviews for [Crusader Kings
III](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158310/Crusader_Kings_III/)
computer game, I've noticed there is a significant difference between
players reviews the Royal Court DLC and the base game.

The purpose is to explore the players' critics and compare the base game
and DLC reviews, making the possible recommendations for improving
player's perceptions.

The project is done using Python for data collection, R for cleaning
data and analysis. Presentation is done in Microsoft PowerPoint and
there is a dashboard created using Tableau Public.
